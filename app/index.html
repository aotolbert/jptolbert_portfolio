                    Thanks for visiting my website! I’ve been working as a math teacher and tutor for over 30 years now, and as a way to continue to support my present and past students (and now, even their children!), I now have this website where I can be reached for math help from 6th grade through PreCalculus!  
                </div>

                    <p>
                        Born in Dublin, Georgia, I graduated from Dublin High School, then attended Mercer University, graduating with a B.A. in Psychology. I also hold a Master of Divinity from Columbia Theological Seminary, and am an ordained pastor in the Presbyterian Church, USA.  My husband and I currently live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  We have three grown sons, and together, we all enjoy live music, movies, Broadway plays, M*A*S*H reruns and soccer—both Major League Soccer and English Premier League. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        I began my teaching career in the classroom, and had five years of classroom teaching prior to giving birth to our first son in 1994. I continued to work as a private tutor for many years as our family grew, allowing me to stay on top of current trends and advances in math education as the standards, policies, and practices changed from year to year.  Through many years of one-on-one tutoring, I have developed the ability to quickly assess the gaps in a student’s mathematical learning, effectively and efficiently fill those gaps in creative ways, building confidence and self-assurance along the way as needed.

                            and when they need it. Her gift is knowing how to read the mood and
                            energy on any given day, an essential skill for someone working
                            closely with middle and high school aged folks! She never failed to
                            motivate my son to work harder and, more importantly, to believe he
                            could succeed. This was as important as the math skills she taught
                            him from sixth through twelfth grade. We owe a great deal to this
                            remarkable person and teacher.”
