                Born in Dublin, Georgia, I graduated from Dublin High School, then attended Mercer University, graduating with a B.A. in Psychology. I also hold a Master of Divinity from Columbia Theological Seminary, and am an ordained pastor in the Presbyterian Church, USA.  My husband and I currently live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  We have three grown sons, and together, we all enjoy live music, movies, Broadway plays, M*A*S*H reruns and soccer—both Major League Soccer and English Premier League.

                I hold a Professional Certificate for 7-12 Mathematics in the state of Maryland, a Standard Certificate for 6-12 Mathematics in Delaware, and a Specialist Certificate in the state of Georgia. I have Georgia endorsements in both Gifted and Special Education, and have 30+ teaching and / or tutoring years of experience in all levels of math, from 6th grade through Pre-Calculus, including Advanced Placement Statistics.

                I began my teaching career in the classroom, and had five years of classroom teaching prior to giving birth to our first son in 1994. I continued to work as a private tutor for many years as our family grew, allowing me to stay on top of current trends and advances in math education as the standards, policies, and practices changed from year to year.  Through many years of one-on-one tutoring, I have developed the ability to quickly assess the gaps in a student’s mathematical learning, effectively and efficiently fill those gaps in creative ways, building confidence and self-assurance along the way as needed. I often use online platforms such as Khan Academy and IXL.com to supplement both low- and high- level learners outside of one-on-one tutoring when appropriate and available. I view my role as a both a teacher and a tutor is not simply subject matter education, but is rather one of support of the whole student. I have a genuine concern for my students, not just the content matter. It is vital to listen to students, genuinely hear what they have to say, and meet them where they are.
